# SolClient
Simple and lightweight Minecraft client for 1.8.9 (and in future newer versions).

In October 2020, I decided to start working on my own Minecraft client, and nearly a year later, I've finally got somewhere.
I know there are too many new clients, but they are usually closed-source clients, that may contain malicious code.

This repository doesn't neccessarily contain the cleanest code, but it does work, and that's enough for me.

## Build Instructions

### Setup
```sh
npm i
```

### Start Launcher
```sh
npm run start
```

### Build Executable
```sh
npm run make
