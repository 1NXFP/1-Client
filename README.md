# SolClient
Simple and lightweight Minecraft client for 1.8.9 (and in future, newer versions).

In October 2020, I decided to start working on my own Minecraft client, and nearly a year later, I've finally got somewhere.

## Why?
I know there are too many new clients, but they are usually closed-source clients, that may contain malicious code.

## Safety
I open sourced this client because not enough clients are open-source (even OptiFine is closed-source).
If you are suspicous, you can easily look through all the code.
